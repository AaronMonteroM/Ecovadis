Churn prediction for Ecovadis
==============================

This project is a test of the Ecovadis candidate selection process. The objective of this test is the development of a predictive model of customer churn. The solution made consists of two main parts:
- Notebooks: An exploratory data analysis (EDA) and an evaluation of the possible models (Models).
- Code (src): Final code for the churn prediction.

Project Organization
